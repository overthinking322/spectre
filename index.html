    <p>
      Spectre, the manifestation of vengeance, is one of the most mysterious and elusive heroes in Dota 2. She is a durable carry with a unique set of abilities that allow her to constantly harass enemies and thrive in prolonged engagements. Her ability to create illusions and teleport across the map makes her a constant threat that cannot be easily escaped.
    </p>
    <p>
      Spectre's role in a team is typically that of a late-game carry. With her high potential for scaling into the late game, she becomes a terrifying presence, capable of dishing out immense damage while being incredibly difficult to kill. She thrives in chaotic team fights, where her damage output and survivability make her an essential threat.
    </p>
    <p>
      Her abilities include the ability to throw a dagger that slows and damages enemies, a passive ability that grants bonus damage against isolated enemies, and a powerful dispersion mechanic that reflects a portion of incoming damage back to nearby foes. Her ultimate, Haunt, allows her to create illusions that confuse and damage enemies, while Spectre herself can freely teleport to one of the illusions, overwhelming her enemies in confusion.
    </p>
    <p>
      Spectre's strength lies in her ability to survive in the most challenging of conditions. Her Dispersion ability allows her to reflect incoming damage, while her Shadow Step offers mobility and control over the battlefield. As a hero who requires good itemization and farm, Spectre may struggle in the early game but can dominate in the mid-to-late game, where she can unleash her full potential.
    </p>
    <p>
      Whether she's pursuing a single target or joining her team in a team fight, Spectre is a force to be reckoned with. Her ability to split the attention of enemies and force them into unfavorable positions makes her a valuable asset to any team, especially when played to her full potential.

      <h2>Lore</h2>
			<p>In the vast fabric of reality, where planes of existence shimmer like veils over one another, there exists a being not born of flesh, but of raw, ethereal vengeance — <em>Mercurial</em>, known to mortals as the <strong>Spectre</strong>.</p>
			<p>She is not merely a warrior. She is a manifestation of agony, a consciousness forged from the chaotic echoes of battle and pain across the multiverse. No one knows exactly what Spectre is — spirit, demon, or something far beyond comprehension. To encounter her is not to see a creature of shadow, but to feel your soul recoil at the cold grasp of your own mortality.</p>
			<p>Spectre does not speak in the way others do. Her voice is a whisper from beyond, a resonance of countless deaths, of memories torn from the minds of the slain. When she appears on the battlefield, she emerges as a reflection — a fragment of herself projected across the realm, striking from unseen corners. Her signature ability, <strong>Haunt</strong>, creates terrifying illusions across the map, each acting independently until she chooses one to fully inhabit, teleporting to it and becoming whole.</p>
			<p>But why does she fight?</p>
			<p>Some say she seeks a true form, that the echoes she sends are fragments she wishes to reclaim — each kill bringing her closer to becoming real. Others believe that her very nature is bound to suffering — that she is a curse, born to answer violence with more violence, forever compelled to echo the pain of the universe.</p>
			<p>Legends whisper that long ago, she may have been something else entirely: a guardian, or perhaps a prisoner, fractured into spectres to prevent her full power from ever being realized again. But now, unleashed in the world of Dota, she is vengeance incarnate — unrelenting, spectral, and inevitable.</p>
			<p>Where Spectre walks, death is not far behind. And even when you think you are alone — she is there, watching from the dark.</p>
